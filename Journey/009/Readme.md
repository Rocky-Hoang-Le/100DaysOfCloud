# Learning about Cloud computing

## Cloud Research

Today I learned more in depth about the benefits of cloud computing and why it is pretty much used in every business that can use it. some of the main key points are that it abstracts the need for on premises servers so businesses can focus more on their product, and its overall cheaper since businesses won't have to worry about having servers that aren't doing work when demand is low. There are also hybrid methods of cloud for businesses that really require their data to be on premises.
