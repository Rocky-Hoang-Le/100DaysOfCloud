# Creating a server with Terraform and Docker

## Introduction

Today I am using the knowledge I learned about Docker and Terraform to create a server to reinforced what I learned on those two topics.

## Use Case

Terraform allows for deployment of cloud infrastructure to different cloud services, and Docker allows the application to be containerized so it can run without having to worry about the underlying technology or infrastructure.

## Cloud Research

I learned commands for Terraform and Docker and how to start and destory a NGINX server. I also learned how to create a 
configuration file for Terraform to use.
