# Learning about AWS Archtecture Diagrams

## Cloud Research

Today I did a review on how to make and create a AWS Architecture
Diagram. It was confusing at first since every time I saw a diagram I just saw a lot of things connect with something else, but after a while If I start from where the user connects to AWS and understand what the services need to go through in order to interact with another service all the way to the end service it becomes easy to break down.
