# Learning machine learning with AWS SageMaker

## Introduction

Today I chose to learn how to train a machine learning model with AWS SageMaker as I have always been interested in machine learning. Specifically I am interested in how I can teach AI with machine learning for game development but also other fields as well.

## Use Case

Machine learning has many potential applications in the real world as once trained for a specific task by providing data it can return useful information such as predicting weather patterns, detecting common words in a document, etc. AWS SageMaker allows the user to deploy an ML model without the usal complexities that accompany it.

## Cloud Research

I mostly just followed the guide on how to use SageMaker here at [Learn AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-train-deploy-machine-learning-model-sagemaker/?trk=el_a134p000003yWILAA2&trkCampaign=DS_SageMaker_Tutorial&sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=Data_Scientist_Hands-on_Tutorial&sc_outcome=Product_Marketing&sc_geo=mult&p=gsrc&c=lp_ds). Again like the previous day I didn't just blindly copy and paste code but rather examnined the code and to see what each line is doing. I also read documentations on the imported libraries to see how to use them.

In the end I got to see machine learning happen in real time as got an understanding on how to make it work using AWS SageMaker. I also learned some steps I should follow like having data to train on as well as data to test on, and for this particular project I looked at the provided csv file and learned how to format to make it work with AWS SageMaker.
