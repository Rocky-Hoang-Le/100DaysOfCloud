# Creating a Turn based game with AWS

## Introduction

I chose this topic today as I enjoy making and coding games on my free time and being able to apply AWS to it will increase my AWS knowledge.

## Use Case

There are many use cases for AWS resources such as notifying users of a game move, updating users about an update on a web browser, holding user information, etc. The specific project today focuses on applying the resources to make a game and notify users whenever the opponent makes a move.

## Cloud Research

Today I learned how to use Cloud9 and further improved my javascript skills as well. I learned how to use command line commands such as node, npm, and bash to run and install scripts as well as understand how the files interact with each other in Cloud9. I learned how to communicate with AWS resources from Cloud9 with AWS SDK and learned a little bit about the Express.js framework for web applications. I also learned a lot more on how to create AWS resources using AWS CLI and AWS SDK such as AWS SNS, AWS Cognito, AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB, and AWS API Gateway.
