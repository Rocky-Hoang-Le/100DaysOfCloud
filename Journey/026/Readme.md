# Learning about AWS EFS

## Cloud Research

Today I reviewed Elastic File System. EFS is a file sharing system that allows for sharing over the cloud. EFS can be mounted to multiple EC2 at a time. EFS is scalable and has different access options like we, such as frequent and infrequent access. EFS is also available across multiple AZs and Regions.
