# Using Cloud9 and SDK

## Introduction

I chose this topic today because I wanted to learn how to use SDK to access and use AWS services.

## Use Case

SDK for AWS can be used to access AWS in the users preferred programming language.

## Cloud Research

I learned how to use Cloud9 IDE and how to install packages and setup credentials using it. I learned how to use the SDK to programmatically use Amazon Rekognition to recognize Pokemon faces with python programming language. Some errors I ran into were command line errors and file directory errors, both which were easily resolved.
