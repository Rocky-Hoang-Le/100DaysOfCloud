# Learning more about AWS SQS and AWS SNS

## Cloud Research

Today I delve deeper into what AWS SQS and AWS SNS is. AWS SQS is a queueing service that serves as a way to decouple components and allow them to still communicate with each other, and there are two types which are standard queue and First in first out (FIFO). AWS SNS is a notification service that works on the publish, subscribe model. AWS SNS can push events to its subscirbers which can be users or other AWS services including AWS SQS.
