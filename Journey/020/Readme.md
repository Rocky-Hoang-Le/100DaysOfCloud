# Learning about AWS Aurora

## Cloud Research

Today I learned about AWS Aurora. AWS Aurora is a fully managed Postgres or MySQL database that scales, creates automatic backups, high availability, and fault tolerance. AWS Aurora creates 6 copies of database across 3 AZs and up to 15 replicas can be made. AWS Aurora can also span multiple regions using Aurora Global Database. AWS Aurora Postgres is 53 faster than regular Postgres, and AWS Aurora MySQL is 5x faster than regular MySQL.
