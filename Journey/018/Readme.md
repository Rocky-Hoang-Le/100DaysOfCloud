# Learning how to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Introduction

Today I chose to learn AWS Elastic Beanstalk so I can learn how to have AWS auto manage my web app.

## Use Case

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is useful when creating a web application without having to worry about the underlying infrasturcture.

## Cloud Research

I learned how to create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk backed application. To use EBS the user must upload their application code onto EBS, and then from there the user can configure some settings for AWS EBS for the resources that EBS will provision such as EC2 instances, ELB, Storage, Auto scaling, etc. Having the project managed by EBS allows for easier deployment as well as an easy way to monitor the application through EBS interface. EBS is free to use and the user only pays for the resources that EBS provsions.
