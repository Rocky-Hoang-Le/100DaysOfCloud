# Learning about Terraform

## Cloud Research

Today I read up documentation on Terrafrom and learned what it was made for and how it is supposed to be used. Terraform is an IaC tool similar to AWS Cloud that allows the user to create, update, and version an AWS infrastructure. Terraform manages these infrasturcutres through configuration files rather than a GUI, and this allows the user to build, change, and manage infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way.

The main steps to follow to deploy an infrastucutre with Terraform are:
- Scope - Identify the infrastucure needs of the project
- Author - Write the configuratio for the infrastructure
- Intialize - Install plugins Terraform needs to manage the infrastucture
- Plan - Preview the changes Terraform will make to match the given configuration
- Apply - Make the planned changes
