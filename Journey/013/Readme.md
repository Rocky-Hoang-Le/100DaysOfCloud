# Learning about CORS

## Cloud Research

Today I learned about CORS, which is a security mechanism which prevents resources from a web domain from being accessed outside of the same domain. For example attempting to use a GET request for a restricted resource from example.com from example2.com which is a different domain. 

I personally experience issues with CORS when creating my resume website as I was trying to call my API from localhost which caused 
a cross origin request error. I resolved this issue by using the correct header when sending the request.
