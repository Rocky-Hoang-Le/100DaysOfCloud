# Creating VPC, Route tables, Internet Gateways and Subnets and using them with EC2

## Introduction

Today I chose this topic so I can reinforced what I learned about VPCs as well have more hands on experience with using different AWS services together.

## Use Case

Having a VPC allows a business to have their own virtual network in the AWS cloud without the need for any hardware or VPNS. The businesses have control over their own network space and control how resources such as EC2 are exposed to the internet.

## Cloud Research

During this project I read documentation on the why and how VPCs, Internet Gateways, and subnets work and why they are useful. I learned that having vpc gives control over network for resources increasing security. I also learned how I can connect to the internet while keeping access to an EC2 resource private disallowing bad actors from accessing my EC2. 

Internet gateways are used to connect a VPC to the internet. Its main purposes are to provide a target for the VPC route table for internet traffic and performs network address translation for instances with IPv4 addresses.

Subnets are used to subdivded a large network into smaller and more effiecint subnetworks. This helps minimize traffic and easier network management control which allows for better security.
