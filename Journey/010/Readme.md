# Creating and modifying AWS EC2 with Terraform

## Introduction

Today I decided to combine all of my knowledge from the previous days about Terraform and put them into practice.

## Prerequisite

Before starting this project the user must know some basic command line commands for terraform and AWS (also make sure AWS CLI and Terraform CLI are installed). The user must also have some idea on how to write Terraform configuration files.

## Use Case

Terraform can be used to codify setup for certain applications such as Heroku so the user will not have to manually add and set things up through a web interface. Terraform is also useful for large groups or organizations as the configuration can be built to scale as well be shared within the organization. Another useful thing about Terraform is it has multi cloud deployment increasing its fault tolerance if a certain region or cloud provider goes down for any reason.

## Cloud Research

During this project I learned more about Terraform, Terraform scripting, and how it interacts with AWS. Terraform scripting is very simliar to yaml with some differences such as, Terraform will show object state differences whereas yaml will not, and Terraform has dynamic templating whereas yaml does not.

Terraform uses providers which are plugins to interact with remote systems such as AWS.

I also learned that Terraform can use variables to set certain information such as an instance name.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

Today I learned a lot more about building cloud infrastucture and specifically how to work with Terraform and AWS. I read documentations to fully in depth learn more about how each part of the terraform configuration file works as well as read up on how Terraform actually manages the resources. This project gave me clearer detail on why Terraform is useful and how I can use it with multiple different services even at the same time to create applications.
