# EC2, AMI, Auto Scaling Groups, and ELBs

## Introduction

Today I chose to study more in depth into EC2 and some of the core things related to EC2 since everything in AWS uses EC2 under the hood.

## Use Case

EC2 are used to spin up virtual servers so the end user does not need to worry about the underlying hardware. 
AMIs are image templates used to create EC2 instances and can be copied to make the same instance over and over.
Auto scaling groups are used to increase or decrease the amount of EC2 instances needed based on traffic.
ELBs are used to direct traffic.

## Cloud Research

I learned a lot more about EC2 such as instance types which are compute optimized, memory optimized, storage optimized, and accelerated hardware. I also learned how AMIs are important and few places to get them such as AMI marketplace. I learned how Auto scaling groups are made and how they are used, as well as ASG policies such as target tracking policy and simple policy with steps. I learned there are 3 different types of ELBs and they all serve the same purpose of redirecting traffic. The three different ELBs are Classic load balancer, Application load balancer, and Network Load Balancer.
