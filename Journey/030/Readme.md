# Learning about API Gateway VPC Link

## Cloud Research

API Gateway VPC Link allows private integration with a Network load balancer, and this allows access to HTTP/HTTPS resources within a VPC without knowledge of the private network configuration. A Use case for this can be making sure a request is authorized through the gateway before the request is received by the NLB. Note that API Gateway Link with RESTful API can only be used with NLB, whereas to use with an ALB it must use a HTTP API where it is already built in.
