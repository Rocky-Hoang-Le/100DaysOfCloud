# Learning about AWS Fargate

## Cloud Research

Today I started learning about AWS Fargate. Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers, and it works with Amazon Elastic container service as well as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes service. Fargate allows for application building without having to worry about the infrastructure, so the user only pays for the resources within the container.
Fargate is flexible in that in scales its compute power to closely match the resource requirements specified for the container, and this makes it so there is no overprovisioning or paying for extra servers. Fargate is also eligible for Spot and compute savings plans.
