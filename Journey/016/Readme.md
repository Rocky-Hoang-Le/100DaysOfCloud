# Creating an RDS database with AWS

## Introduction

Today I chose this topic so I can learn how to use other more about databases in general.

## Use Case

RDS databases are used for data storage with a structured schema. This is good for predictable, finite number of data, or data that is already well defined.

## Cloud Research

During this project I learned how to create a postgres database on AWS and access it using a tool called TablePlus for windows. After accessing it i learned to write sql scripts to input as well as query data within the database using SQL language. I also learned how to backup the database and use performance insights to monitor its performance.
